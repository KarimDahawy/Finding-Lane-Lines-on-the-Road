# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
---


## Overview
---

The Purpose of this project is to detect the lane lines on the road by creating a Pipeline algrothim, So the vehicle will use these lines to be able to steer/control its direction. I will use in this project some computer visions algrothims like **Canny Edgy Detection** and **Hough Transfor**, Create a pipeline algrothim and apply it on some static pictures to detect the output lines, then I will modify the algrothim and apply it on some stream videos in order to have output videos with detected lane lines.
