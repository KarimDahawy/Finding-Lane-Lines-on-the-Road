# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 
---


## Overview
---

The Purpose of this project is to detect the lane lines on the road by creating a Pipeline algrothim, So the vehicle will use these lines to be able to steer/control its direction. I will use in this project some computer visions algrothims like **Canny Edgy Detection** and **Hough Transfor**, Create a pipeline algrothim and apply it on some static pictures to detect the output lines, then I will modify the algrothim and apply it on some stream videos in order to have output videos with detected lane lines.


## Project

### 1. Desciption of Pipeline

My pipeline consists of steps as follows:

1. Convert detected image into gray scale.

2. Apply Gaussian Blur filter in order to smooth the image.

3. Apply Canny Edge Detection on the filtered image with a defined low and high threshold using a 1:2 ratio.

4. 


**The following image identifies how the pipelines works on 6 different images:**
